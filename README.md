# ffp-project: LambDraw!

Welcome to my final project in advanced functional programming of 2014/15.

LambDraw is a tool to provide G-Code for the LambDraw Plotter a selfbuild CoreXY-Drawing Machine.

# The steps:

1. Take an Image as Input
2. Reduce the Image in Size and Colors to a 4-Color Palette. 
3. Take each Color-Plane and produce G-Code
4. Send G-Code via USB to Motorcontroller (Arduino)
